// Single Cycle CPU

Summary:

In the fall of 2016 semester, I took a class called computer organization, where the semester project was to 
design a single cycle CPU.


Hardware used:

Altera DE2 Board FPGA device

Software used:

Quartus -  upload VHDL code to the FPGA device
ModelSim - used to test VHDL code components of this CPU



How to run the single cycle cpu software?

1.) Download the "SingleCycleCPU_files" folder.
2.) Download the "SingleCycleCPUPinOuts" for the board.
3.) Open Quartus and browse to the folder.
4.) Open the "ProcessorSingleCycle" project.
5.) Compile it.
6.) Upload to the board.
7.) Upload the pinouts to the board.
8.) Begin working with the Altera DE2 board.



Please follow the link below to see the output of the FPGA device.

Note:
One segment light isn't working, the second to the left of the DE2 board.


What I learned: 

1.) Datapath and Critical path 
2.) Creating my own instruction set = my own processor.
3.) Learn to hard code machine code based on instruction set that I created 
    (format of an instruction for example).
4.) I used the instruction set to code Fibonacci Sequence.
